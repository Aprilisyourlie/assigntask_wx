RNA editing is a post-transcriptional phenomenon involving the insertion/deletion or substitution of specific bases in precise RNA localizations. In human, RNA editing occurs by deamination of cytosine to uridine (C-to-U) or mostly by the adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) conversion through ADAR enzymes. A-to-I substitutions may have profound functional consequences and have been linked to a variety of human diseases including neurological and neurodegenerative disorders or cancer. Next generation sequencing technologies offer the unique opportunity to investigate in depth RNA editing even though no dedicated software has been released up to now. REDItools are simple python scripts conceived to facilitate the investigation of RNA editing at large-scale and devoted to research groups that would to explore such phenomenon in own data.', 'Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim.

Originally developed by Paracel, a Celera Business, this code base was released as open source in 2006. TraceTuner was used by Celera to call 30+ million reads from both Drosophila and human genome sequencing projects. In 2000, Applied Biosystems bundled TraceTuner with ABI3700 Genome Analyzers and shipped it to the customers of these capillary electrophoresis sequencers. Later versions of TraceTuner, which support mixed base calling, have been used by the research community, the private biotech sector, and the U.S. government as components of different variant detection, genotyping and forensic software applications (e.g. Applied Biosystems SeqScape, Paracel Genome Assembler, MTexpert, etc.).', 'Suite of tools for DNA sequence analysis - searching (EST, mRNA, sequencer reads); aligning (ESTs, mRNA, whole genome); and analysis (repeats, kmers).', 'Significance Analysis of Interacome: probabilistic filtering of quantitative AP-MS data.');

The filter is named for Rudolf (Rudy) E. Kálmán, one of the primary developers of its theory.

The Wiener filter problem is to reduce the amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimation of the desired noiseless signal. The discrete-time equivalent of Wiener\'s work was derived independently by Kolmogorov and published in 1941. Hence the theory is often called the Wiener-Kolmogorov filtering theory.

However, Most previous coding potential prediction methods heavily rely on alignment, either pairwise alignment to search for protein evidence or multiple alignments to calculate phylogenetic conservation score (such as CPC , PhyloCSF and RNACode ). This is because most previously identified transcripts including protein coding RNA and short, housekeeping/regulatory RNAs such as snRNAs, snoRNA and tRNA are highly conserved.

Michigan-style LCS algorithms constitute a unique class of algorithms that distribute learned patterns over a collaborative population of of individually interpretable IF:THEN rules, allowing them to flexibly and effectively describe complex and diverse problem spaces. ExSTraCS was primarily developed to address problems in epidemiological data mining to identify complex patterns relating predictive attributes in noisy datasets to disease phenotypes of interest. ExSTraCS combines a number of recent advancements into a single algorithmic platform. It can flexibly handle (1) discrete or continuous attributes, (2) missing data, (3) balanced or imbalanced datasets, and (4) binary or many classes. A complete users guide for ExSTraCS is included. Coded in Python 2.7.', 'MATS is a computational tool to detect differential alternative splicing events from RNA-Seq data. The statistical model of MATS calculates the P-value and false discovery rate that the difference in the isoform ratio of a gene between two conditions exceeds a given user-defined threshold. From the RNA-Seq data, MATS can automatically detect and analyze alternative splicing events corresponding to all major types of alternative splicing patterns. MATS handles replicate RNA-Seq data from both paired and unpaired study design.
